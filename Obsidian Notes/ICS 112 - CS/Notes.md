- Phases of Software Engineering
	1) check feasibility
	2) requirement analysis & specification
	3) design
	4) coding & testing
	5) integration & system testing
	6) maintenance

- Problem -> puzzle that requires logical thought and mathematics to solve
	- could be a set of questions and constraints based on a scenario

- Algorithmic Problem -> can be solved with a sequence of actions

- Computational Problem -> process of evolution from one state to another according to some rules
	- Decision Problem -> make a decision based on some condition
	- Searching & Sorting Problem
	- Counting Problem
	- Optimization Problem -> find best solution from several several ones

- Logic -> method of human through -> linear thinking to solve a problem

- Problem Solving Process
	1) understanding the problem
	2) identifying input / output of the problem
	3) analyzing alternate ways to solve the problem
	4) flowchart / pseudocode
	5) implementation - converting pseudocode to executable code
	6) debugging
	7) testing
	8) go to step 5)

- Pre-programming Phase
	- understand and analyze the problem & determine whether it can be solved by a computer
	- Identify the following:
		- data requirement
		- processing requirement / procedure
		- output

	- Problem Analysis Chart (PAC)
		- Data - given in the problem / provided by user
		- Processing - list of processing required / procedures
		- Output
		- Solution Alternatives

- Algorithm -> set of instructions to solve a problem
	- eg. Average of 3 numbers.
		1) start
		2) get first number
		3) get second number
		4) get third number
		5) add the numbers
		6) divide the sum by 3
		7) display the result
		8) stop
	- Characteristics:
		- clear and unambiguous
		- well defined inputs
		- well defined outputs
		- finiteness -> shouldn't start an infinite loop
		- feasible -> shouldn't call upon inaccessible technology
		- language independent
	- Patterns in an Algorithm:
		- sequential -> executes statements in the order in which they appear
		- selective (conditional) -> controls the flow of statements based on some condition
		- iterative (loop) -> used when a part of the algorithm needs to be executed several times

- Flowcharts
	- graphical representation of the individual steps to implement a task
	- independent of programming language
