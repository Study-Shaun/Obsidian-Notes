- Electric Potential Energy
	- Work done to move ⊕ from a to b
		- W$_{ab}$ = -∆U
			=> F . d = - (U$_b$ - U$_a$)

- direction of e$^-$ flow is opposite to the direction of the electric field
	- conventional current flows is the direction of the electric field

- Intrinsic Semiconductor -> single (pure) crystal
	- no defects (impurities)
	- Si - outer shells: 4sp$^3$ hybrid orbitals
		- 3s$^2$ & 3p$^2$

- How far can e$^-$ travel before lattice scattering? (i.e. e$^-$ and h$^+$ drift through the material)
	- define a quantity called mobility
		- µ$_e$
